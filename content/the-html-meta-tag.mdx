The &lt;meta&gt; tag is used to define the metadata about the HTML document. Metadata is data or information about the data. The &lt;meta&gt; tag is written inside the &lt;head&gt; tag.

The &lt;meta&gt; tag can have the following attributes —

1. **name**: If the name attribute is set, _document-level_ metadata is provided

1. **http-equiv**: If the http-equiv attribute is set, the meta element is a _pragma directive_, providing information equivalent to what can be given by a similarly-named HTTP header. In simple terms, it indicates the program to perform an action.

1. **charset**: If the charset attribute is set, the meta element is a c*harset declaration*, giving the character encoding in which the document is encoded. Most common charset used is UTF-8 and is understood by all common browsers. Check [IANA character sets](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml) for all available character encodings.

1. **content**: This attribute contains the _value_ for the http-equiv or name attribute, depending on which is used.

1. **itemprop**: This attribute is available for every HTML element and when used with &lt;meta&gt; tag the meta element provides _user-defined_ metadata. An itemprop consists of a name-value pair. Each name-value pair is called a property, and a group of one or more properties forms an item.

Few examples —

charset : In the below example we set the character encoding to UTF-8

`\n<head>\n <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<head/>\n`

http-equiv : This example will refresh the document very 30 seconds.

`\n<head>\n <meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"30\">\n<head/>\n`

name : One of the more common use cases for using the name attribute is used to set the viewport. The viewport is the user’s visible area of a web page and varies from one device to another. Setting the viewport is ensures that the website looks good on all devices.

`\n<head>\n <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n</head>\n`

The basic Emmet HTML preset looks like this —

As you can see above, two &lt;meta&gt; tags are used. One for defining the charset, and the second defines the viewport. These two can be termed as the more important &lt;meta&gt; tags that should be defined.
