In the words of its authors - Express is a \"Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js\". It is also one of the most popular Node.js web frameworks.

<br />
So you want to set up an Express server, this article will help you do just that.

## Prerequisites

### Local machine

To set up an Express server, you will need NodeJS and npm installed on your machine. After successful installation of node and npm, create a folder and run :

```node
npm init
```

```jsx
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
let supabase = createClient("https://<project>.supabase.co", "<your-anon-key>");
let { data } = await supabase.from("countries").select();
```

This is a utility that will help you create a package.json file. This file will hold all the metadata about your project like name, versioning, dependencies, etc. You can learn more about this in the official [nodejs docs.](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-the-file-package-json/) \n\n### Preconfigured Online IDEs\nYou can skip the above setup and directly use online IDEs. I have linked a Repl at the end of the article where you can find the full code.\n\n## Installing Express\nThe express package needs to be installed to run the express server.\n`\nnpm install express\n`\nThis command installs the express npm package. For Repl, you may just import the package in the index.js file.\n\n## Express code\n### Boilerplate\n`\nconst express = require('express');\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('My express app');\n});\n\nconst PORT = 3000;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log('server started at PORT: ', PORT);\n});\n`\nThis is the basic code required to start an express server.\nTo send JSON data do the following : \n`\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.json({success: true, message: \"Express server connected\"});\n});\n`\n### body-parser\nThis package helps in parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.\n\nThis helps in sending JSON bodies to the server required in a POST API call.\n\n### Routing\nTo make the code clean and modular we can make use of express routers.\nAs an example, we will create a category router. In the routers/categories.router.js file add the following code :\n`\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nlet categories = [\n  {id: 1, name: \"Cat 1\"},\n  {id: 2, name: \"Cat 2\"},\n  {id: 3, name: \"Cat 3\"}\n]\n\nrouter.route(\"/\")\n  .get(async (req, res) => {\n    try {\n      res.json({ success: true, categories })\n    } catch (error) {\n      res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: \"Unable to get categories\", errorMessage: error.message });\n    }\n  }).post(async (req, res) => {\n    try {\n      const category = req.body;\n      categories = [...categories, category];\n      res.json({ success: true, categories });\n    }\n    catch (error) {\n      res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: \"Unable to create category\", errorMessage: error.message });\n    }\n  })\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n`\nHere we are making use of an array, in projects, this is replaced by databases like MongoDB.\n\nAfter the above changes, our index.js file looks like this - \n`\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst bodyParser = require(\"body-parser\");\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\nconst categoryRouter = require(\"./routers/categories.router\");\napp.use(\"/category\", categoryRouter);\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.json({success: true, message: \"Express server\"});\n});\n\nconst PORT = 3000;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log('server started at PORT: ', PORT);\n});\n`\nIn the above code, we have imported the category router, all the routes defined under this router will be preceded by `/category`. So the category GET API call will be `https://localhost:3000/category`, in your local machine.\n\nThe browser will show the following result on the page -\n\n![expresseg1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628151231270/6AuYSB0ax.png)\n\nYou can check out this [Repl ](https://replit.com/@HalfCold/Express-Exmaple#index.js) to find the full code and fork it to customize it to your needs.\n\nHope this article helped you in getting started with Express.\nTo explore more check out these links - \n1.
