Hey folks! This article will help you to configure Cloudinary and upload images from your React application to the cloud using the Cloudinary API.

# Prerequisites

Before continuing make sure you have created a Cloudinary account.

## Configuring Upload presets

After you have created your account, go to your account settings. In the Upload section you will find the option to _Add upload preset_.

Here you need to create a new upload preset with the following settings -

- Unique filename : true
- Delivery type : upload
- Access mode : public

This creates an Unsigned Upload preset. You can later play around with the access settings to make it private.

Now you are all setup to upload images to your Cloudinary media library.

# Code

Create the input element that accepts appropriate image file types.

```jsx
<input
  type="file"
  accept="image/png, image/jpeg, image/jpg"
  multiple={false}
  onChange={onSelectFile}
/>
```

## Input onChange event

When the onChange of the input is triggered, onSelectFile method is called. To capture the changes we will use useState.
Following are the states we will be using -

```jsx
const [previewImage, setPreviewImage] = useState(null);
const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null);
const [uploadedURL, setUploadedURL] = useState(null);
```

The onSelectFile method two things -

- Reads the file as selected in the input
- Sets the preview image and the selected image

```jsx
const onSelectFile = (event) => {
  const file = event.target.files[0];
  let reader = new FileReader();
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  reader.onloadend = (e) => {
    setPreviewImage(reader.result);
  };
  setSelectedFile(file);
};
```

## Previewing image before upload

User should be able to preview the image before upload. So, lets add an image tag for previewing image and a Remove button to delete the image and select a new one.

```jsx
{
  previewImage && (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setPreviewImage(null)}>Remove</button>
    </div>
  );
}
{
  previewImage && (
    <div>
      Preview
      <img src={previewImage} alt="selected" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Uploading the image

To handle uploads lets create a upload button and a method to handle the button click.

```jsx
{
  selectedFile && <button onClick={() => uploadImage()}>Upload</button>;
}
```

```jsx
const uploadImage = async () => {
  try {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("file", selectedFile);
    formData.append("upload_preset", "your-image-preset");
    formData.append("folder", "your-folder-name");
    const response = await axios.post(
      "https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/your-cloud-name/image/upload",
      formData,
    );
    setUploadedURL(response.data.secure_url);
    setPreviewImage(null);
    setSelectedFile(null);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

The uploadImage method is an async method as it will be handling API calls.
To upload images we need to create a FormData object and append required properties.

1.  First we append the type i.e. _file_ with the selected image file.
2.  Then append the upload preset that we made in the Cloudinary prerequisites section.
3.  The third step is optional but good to follow. Here you have an option to add a folder to which the files will be uploaded.

Finally the API call is made to this API - *https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/your-cloud-name/image/upload*
Here you need to replace \"your-cloud-name\" with the cloud name of your Cloudinary account found on the Dashboard.

After a successful upload the response body has an attribute called _secure_url_. This is the public URL that you can use to access the image.

Note: Remember to add your cloud name and upload preset to successfully upload images.
